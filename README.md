http2 explained
===============

This is a detailed document (and associated presentation) describing http2,
the background, concepts, protocol and something about existing
implementations and what the future might hold.

See http://daniel.haxx.se/http2/ for the canonical home for this project where
there's also a more friendly PDF format of this document available. I hope to
host and announce updates to this document there.

CONTRIBUTING
------------

I encourage and welcome help and contributions from anyone who may have
improvements to offer. As the source is an FODT file, pull requests and diff
probably won't work very well so let's try to file issues or send email to
