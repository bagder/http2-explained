# 1. Background

This document describes http2 from a technical and protocol level. It started
out as a presentation Daniel did in Stockholm in April 2014 that was
subsequently converted and extended into a full-blown document with all
details and proper explanations.

RFC 7540 is the official name of the final http2 specification and it was published on May 15th, 2015: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.txt

All and any errors in this document are my own and the results of my
shortcomings. Please point them out, and they will be fixed in updated
versions.

In this document, I've tried to consistently use the word "http2" to describe
the new protocol while in purely technical terms, the proper name is HTTP/2. I
made this choice for the sake of readability and to get a better flow in the
language.

## 1.1 Author

My name is Daniel Stenberg. I've been working with open source and networking
for over twenty years in numerous projects. Possibly I'm best known for being
the lead developer of curl and libcurl. I've been involved in the IETF HTTPbis
working group for several years and there I've kept up-to-date with the
refreshed HTTP 1.1 work as well as being involved in the http2 standardization
work.
